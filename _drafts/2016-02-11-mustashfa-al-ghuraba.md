# notes

- on the meaning itself
    - The Arabic *ghurabāʾ*, "foreigner", is in fact the Ottoman *ġurebā*, which relates to the poor. Thus, one finds *ġurebā ḫastaḫānesi*s as mostly municipal hospitals for the (registered) poor all across the empire; c.f. {Boyar 2009@146} and various issues of *Servet-i Fünūn*:
        + {servet-mka 32860@164} providing a photo of the ground-breaking ceremony for the gureba hastahanesi in Erzerum.
    - This reading is further supported by the regular publication of the hospital’s statistics in *Sūriye*. Poor houses were called *ġurebāḫāne*, see {Özbek 2009@795}. 
- the common mis-reading:
    + In the case of the (municipal) hospital for the poor in Damascus, most authors refer to it as the Ghurabāʾ hospital and treat it as a name, instead of a functional description; e.g. {Weber 2005a; Weber 2006; Weber 2009@152}.
    + Najīb Elias Salībā translated it as "strangers’ hospital"; {Saliba 1971@302}
    + Jens Hanssen reads the establishment of a *mustashfā al-ghurabāʾ* in Beirut as part of "a concerted Hamidian effort to assume medical responsibility over Arab provincial subjects by establishing hospitals for the ‘alienated’ (mustashfā al-ghurabāʾ) in each of the provincial capitals of Bilad al-Sham."^[{Hanssen 2005@134}]
