After posting the [last comment]({% post_url 2011-03-31-ottoman-yearbooks-online %}) on the exclusive and excluding collections of Ottoman yearbooks, I just found that the [Hakki Tarık Us collection](http://www.tufs.ac.jp/common/fs/asw/tur/htu/) at the Beyazit Devlet Kütüphanesi made large parts of its holdings available online in a cooperation with the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies. Yearbooks, private newspapers, and official gazettes are available in the superb DjVu format, free of charge to every member of the public, and with no restrictions on downloads and further use. All you need is the open source DjVu browser plug-in, which has the somewhat undocumented limitation to run only in 32 bit mode. If one happens to run the latest OSX iteration this is achieved by ticking a box in the application’s (Safari, Firefox, etc.) information dialog inside the finder.
