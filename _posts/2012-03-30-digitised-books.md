Today, I discovered that the [Heinrich Heine Universitäts- und Landesbibliothek](http://www.uni-duesseldorf.de/home/en/home.html) in Düsseldorf provides a growing body of currently 8.000+ digitised items, including metadata (METS XML), and adhering to the URN scheme of the Deutsche Nationabibliothek for public use.

For instance, I had searched for a rare report on the German emperor Wilhelm II’s journey to Jerusalem in 1898, previously available as a scan from google books[1]:

> [Mühlmann, Felix. Das Deutsche Kaiserpaar im Heiligen Lande im Herbst 1898. Berlin: E. S. Mittler & Sohn, 1899](http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:hbz:061:1-64799).

Unfortunately, as is the case with google, they do only provide the scanned pages, but no OCR or transcribed full-text. The corpus also includes some [24 newspapers and journals](http://digital.ub.uni-duesseldorf.de/nav/index/all?&facets=type%3D%22document%2C21%22), predominantly concerned with either the Rhine area or–for whatever reason–fashion, as well as [1.600+ maps](http://digital.ub.uni-duesseldorf.de/nav/index/all?&facets=type%3D%22document%2C9%22).
