This post is a short update to [my recent post on different versions of *Düstur*]({% post_url 2012-12-29-the-historians-puzzle %})

The index to the first series of *Düstur*, published in 1891 as "Ḳaraḳoç, Sarkiz. *Miftāḥ-i Ḳavānīn-i ʿOŝmāniye*. Der-i Saʿādet: Maḥmūd Bey Maṭbaʿası, 1309 aH [1891]", does not contain any information on divergent print-runs and editions.
