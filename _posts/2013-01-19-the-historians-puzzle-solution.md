This post is a short update to [my recent post on different versions of *Düstur*]({% post_url 2012-12-29-the-historians-puzzle %})

Safa Saracoglu solved at least part of the riddle by pointing out via email that, before *Düstur* became a series from 1872 onwards, three independent volumes were published under the same title in in 1851, 1863, and 1866.  Hence, what I thought of as the first edition of the first volume of the first series of *Düstur* was indeed the 1863 volume.
