This post is more of a continuously updated note on possible workflows that are based on plain text and the principles of minimal computing.

# Plain text and MarkDown

## AcademicMarkdown

## CriticMarkup

[CriticMarkup](http://macdrifter.com/2013/02/everyones-a-critic-the-critic-markup-language-proposal.html): extension to MMD for editorial markup of texts. The project website is [http://criticmarkup.com/](http://criticmarkup.com/) and the code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/CriticMarkup/CriticMarkup-toolkit)

- Integration into tools:
    + Sublime Text 3's AcademicMarkdown package supports syntax highlighting for CriticMarkup
    + There is a CriticMarkup [SL3 package](https://github.com/CriticMarkup/CriticMarkup-toolkit/tree/master/Sublime%20Text%203%20Package/). It is not managed by package control and a documentation can be found [here](http://criticmarkup.com/sublime-text.php)
    + The [CriticMarkup toolkit](https://github.com/CriticMarkup/CriticMarkup-toolkit) contains processors for various programs but not for Sublime Text.
    + [Integration of CriticMarkup and Pandoc](http://vitruviandesign.blogspot.com/2014/05/more-reasons-to-love-markdown-plus.html)

+ Basic Syntax
    * Addition `{++ ++}`
    * Deletion `{-- --}`
    * Substitution `{~~ ~> ~~}`
    * Comment `{>> <<}`
    * Highlight `{== ==}{>> <<}`

# KramDown

An extension of MarkDown with a strict, unambiguous syntax used in Jekyll. The documentation of the syntax can be found [here](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html).

# Pandoc and Jekyll

Pandoc can be used as standard processor for markdown in jekyll with the help of small [plugins](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/). However, one cannot use any plug-ins if jekyll is run on GitHub-pages, which operate in safe-mode. There was a lengthy discussion on the [jekyll forum](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/1973) whether or not to include pandoc as a markdown processor. Unfortunately this has been rejected by the jekyll team.

The advantage of pandoc as markdown processor would be support for image captions etc.

##  [jekyll-pandoc](https://github.com/mfenner/jekyll-pandoc)

To install it via terminal type

`$ gem install jekyll-pandoc`

It can then be referenced in one's site's `_config.yml` as `markdown: pandoc` after the following has been added:

~~~
gems: 
    - jekyll-pandoc
~~~


## [jekyll-pandoc-plugin](https://github.com/9peppe/jekyll-pandoc-plugin)

This was originally designed to work with jekyll 1.x. Some forks have been updated to provide compatibility with jekyll 2.x and 3.x

## Liquid templating

Liquid templating was designed by and for the shopify website: "Liquid is an open-source, Ruby-based template language created by Shopify. It is the backbone of Shopify themes and is used to load dynamic content on storefronts."

## Images in Jekyll

the standard markdown syntax of `![caption, alt text](path to image file)` works with jekyll, but the alt text is not written to a caption element etc.

A [comment on stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19331362/using-an-image-caption-in-markdown-jekyll) suggests to generate a new template file called `image.html` in `_includes`

~~~{.html}
<figure class="image">
    <img src="{{ include.url }}" alt="{{ include.description }}">
    <figcaption>{{ include.description }}</figcaption>
</figure>
~~~ 

and then to call this template with 

~~~{.}
{% include image.html url="/images/my-cat.jpg" description="My cat, Robert Downey Jr." %}
~~~

The regex to replace existing markdown image links with the new liquid ones is:

1. find: `!\[(Page.+)\]\(\{\{site.baseurl\}\}(/images/.+.png)\)`
2. replace>
