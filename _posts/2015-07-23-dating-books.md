I am currently preparing my thesis for publication and the process of revision, I am again turning to Ottoman legal texts and their translations. Today I want to come briefly back to a question I have extensively dealt with in my thesis: The difficulty of dating printed sources from the late Ottoman *Bilād al-Shām*.

The second volume of Nawfal Niʿmat Allah Nawfal's translation of Ottoman laws[^2] edited by Khalīl Khūrī and published by *al-Maṭbaʿa al-Adabiyya* in Beirut carries the date 1301 on its cover. The calendar of this dating could either be Muslim 1301 *hijrī*, which would translate to 1883/84 Gregorian, or Ottoman 1301 *mālī*, which began on 13 March 1885. So far, so common and without further ado---and I strongly suspect without further thought---the [world's libraries](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11351292/editions?editionsView=true&referer=di "link to wordcat") catalogued the book as having been publised in 1883. The content of the book as well as the publishing house---*al-Maṭbaʿa al-Adabiyya* was a venture by Khalīl Sarkīs[^4], the Greek Orthodox owner of Beirut's most successful periodical and only daily newspaper <!-- was it already a daily in 1887? --> *Lisān al-Ḥāl*---raise the probability for *mālī* reckoning. 

Then I came across announcements of its publication in the Beiruti press. Both *Lisān al-Ḥāl* and *Thamarāt al-Funūn* ran adverts for the new publication on their front pages in May 1887.[^3] Against the backdrop of the book's publisher printing announcements in his own newspaper it now seemed likely that the second volume had inherited the date of publication from the first volume and was indeed printed only in 1887. 

Unlike the [first volume](http://hdl.handle.net/2027/inu.30000088981760) scans of the second cannot be found online, but I was lucky to locate a copy at the  library of the American University of Beirut. To my surprise the volume carried an ownership stamp on its last page:

{% include image.html url="/images/nawfal-dustur-v2-stamp.jpg" description="Stamp" %}

It reads in French and Arabic:

>Librairie Universelle 1883 Beyrout

>*li-l-maktaba al-jāmiʿa li-**Khalīl al-Khūrī** 1883 Bayrūt*

and seemingly indicates that the copy at AUB once belonged to the editor of the book, Khalīl al-Khūrī, himself. The stamp also records a Gregorian date: 1883. If this was the date of acquisition, the stamp could prove that the volume was indeed published in 1301 *hijrī*. Going through my research notes, however, it appeared that the *Librairie Universelle* was a publishing press and bookstore rather than a library run by the brothers Amīn and Khalīl al-Khūrī in Beirut. It is unclear when they had established the printing press, but at least by 1887 they had adopted the more common Arabic term for a publishing press: *al-maṭbaʿa al-jāmiʿ*.[^1] But why would a bookstore stamp its merchandise?

For the moment this question must remain as open as the opening date of the endeavour.
