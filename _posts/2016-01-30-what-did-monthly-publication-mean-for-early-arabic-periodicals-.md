I am frequently returning to the issue of multiple calendars and conceptions of the day in the context of late Ottoman *Bilād al-Shām*. Most of my research is at least partially based on newspapers and other periodicals from the region that made use of at least four calendars: Muslim *hijrī*, Ottoman fiscal or *mālī* (sometimes also called *rūmī*), the reformed Julian *rūmī* (or *sharqI*), and finally the Gregorian calendar (*gharbī*). 

I am currently working on the [digital edition of Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī's "monthly" journal *al-Muqtabas*](https://www.github.com/tillgraller/digital-muqtabas) and I frequently encounter difficulties in establishing bibliographic metadata for individual issues. Thus, I would like to share few observations in this blog post.

Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī published the monthly journal *al-Muqtabas* between 1906 and 1917/18. The publication schedule followed the Muslim *hijrī* calendar and, after the Young Turk Revolution of July 1908, publication moved from Cairo to Damascus in the journal's third year.

There is some confusion as to the counting of issues and their publication dates. Samir Seikaly argues that Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī was wrong in stating in his memoirs that he had published 8 volumes of 12 issues each and two independent issues.[^1] But the actual hard copies at the [Orient-Institut Beirut](http://www.orient-institut.org) and the digital facsimiles from HathiTrust show that Kurd ʿAlī was right insofar as volume 9 existed and comprised 2 issues only. As it turns out, *al-Muqtabas* also published a number of double issues: [Vol. 4 no. 5/6](https://rawgit.com/tillgrallert/ArabicTeiEdition/master/MajallatMuqtabas/xml/oclc_4770057679-i_41.TEIP5.xml) and [Vol. 8 no. 11/12](https://rawgit.com/tillgrallert/ArabicTeiEdition/master/MajallatMuqtabas/xml/oclc_4770057679-i_94.TEIP5.xml).

According to the masthead and the cover sheet, *al-Muqtabas*'s publication schedule followed the Islamic *hijrī* calendar (from the journal itself it must remain open whether the recorded publication dates were the actual publication dates). Sometimes the printers made errors: [issue 2 of volume 4](https://rawgit.com/tillgrallert/ArabicTeiEdition/master/MajallatMuqtabas/xml/oclc_4770057679-i_38.TEIP5.xml), for instance, carries Rab I 1327 aH as publication date on the cover sheet, but Ṣaf 1327 aH in its masthead. The latter would correspond to the official publication schedule. External sources, such as reports in the daily newspaper *al-Muqtabas*, also published by Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī in Damascus, indicate that the actual publication sequence was indeed not too tightly tied to the monthly publication schedule:

- *Thamarāt al-Funūn* 29 Jan. 1906 / 4 Dhu II 1323 aH (#1548) announced the publication of [no.2 of *Majallat al-Muqtabas*](https://rawgit.com/tillgrallert/ArabicTeiEdition/master/MajallatMuqtabas/xml/oclc_4770057679-i_2.TEIP5.xml) two months earlier than the date indicated in the issue's masthead: Ṣafar 1324 aH.[^5] This also contradicts Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī's memoirs, where he states that publication of *Muqtabas* commenced in early 1324 aH.[^11]

- *al-Muqtabas* 16 May 1910 / 7 Jum I 1328 aH (#371) announced the publication of a "no. 10" of *Majallat al-Muqtabas*. [No.10 of the fifth volume](https://rawgit.com/tillgrallert/ArabicTeiEdition/master/MajallatMuqtabas/xml/oclc_4770057679-i_57.TEIP5.xml) would have been published for/in Shaw 1328 aH (Oct/Nov 1910), thus the short note must refer to [no.10 of the fourth volume](https://rawgit.com/tillgrallert/ArabicTeiEdition/master/MajallatMuqtabas/xml/oclc_4770057679-i_45.TEIP5.xml) that should have been published for/in Shaw 1327 aH (Oct/Nov 1909)! This assumption is confirmed by the short description of the issue's content provided in the announcement.[^4]
- *al-Muqtabas* 2 Jul. 1910 (#411) confirmed the overall delay in publication and announced [issue 12 of vol.4](https://rawgit.com/tillgrallert/ArabicTeiEdition/master/MajallatMuqtabas/xml/oclc_4770057679-i_47.TEIP5.xml), which should have appeared for/in Dhu II 1327 aH (Dec 1909/ Jan 1910).[^6]

- Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī and his staff seemingly entered a productive period in fall 1910, publishing eight "monthly" issues in three months:
    - *al-Muqtabas* 13 Sep. 1910 (#473) announced [no.3 of vol. 5](https://rawgit.com/tillgrallert/ArabicTeiEdition/master/MajallatMuqtabas/xml/oclc_4770057679-i_50.TEIP5.xml) that should have been published for/in Rab I 1328 aH (Mar/Apr 1910).[^7] But publication speed picked up and
    - only eleven days later, *al-Muqtabas* 24 Sep. 1910 (#482) announced the publication of [no.4 of vol.5](https://rawgit.com/tillgrallert/ArabicTeiEdition/master/MajallatMuqtabas/xml/oclc_4770057679-i_51.TEIP5.xml).[^8]
    - *al-Muqtabas* 12 Dec. 1910 (#548) announced the publication of [no.10 of vol.5](https://rawgit.com/tillgrallert/ArabicTeiEdition/master/MajallatMuqtabas/xml/oclc_4770057679-i_57.TEIP5.xml) of Shaw 1328 aH (Oct/Nov 1910).[^9]
- *al-Muqtabas* 18 Jun. 1911 (#706) advertised Jamāl al-Dīn al-Qāsimī's three-partite article *al-fatwā fī al-islām* ([part one](https://rawgit.com/tillgrallert/digital-muqtabas/master/xml/oclc_4770057679-i_61.TEIP5.xml#div_2.d1e1517), [two](https://rawgit.com/tillgrallert/digital-muqtabas/master/xml/oclc_4770057679-i_62.TEIP5.xml#div_2.d1e1491), and [three](https://rawgit.com/tillgrallert/digital-muqtabas/master/xml/oclc_4770057679-i_63.TEIP5.xml#div_7.d1e1810)) published from no.2 of vol.6 (Ṣafar 1329 / Feb 1911) onwards and mentioned that the copy of *Majallat al-Muqtabas* was sold for 1.5 *beşlik*s.[^10]
- *al-Muqtabas* 1 Jul. 1911 / 4 Raj 1329 aH (#717) announced the publication of two issues, [no.5](https://rawgit.com/tillgrallert/ArabicTeiEdition/master/MajallatMuqtabas/xml/oclc_4770057679-i_64.TEIP5.xml) and [6 of vol.6](https://rawgit.com/tillgrallert/ArabicTeiEdition/master/MajallatMuqtabas/xml/oclc_4770057679-i_65.TEIP5.xml), which according to the publication schedule should have been published in late April and late May respectively.[^2]

Similar confusion shrouds the end of publication in mystery. As no publication dates were actually provided in the mastheads of individual issues and since the issue wrappers were mostly discarded upon binding the issues into volumes, the only surviving explicit dating is provided by the volumes' cover sheets. According to its covers sheet, volume 8 was published through 1332 aH, i.e. between December 1913 and November 1914. However an [article in issue 9](xml/oclc_4770057679-i_91.TEIP5.xml#p_98.d1e2707) reports on the inauguration of a Mosque in Berlin at the end of Ram 1333 aH (mid-August 1915). The same issue reviews a number of books printed in 1333 aH and [one book published in 1334 aH](xml/oclc_4770057679-i_91.TEIP5.xml#div_24.d1e3028) in addition to the announcement of a publication on the ["first year of the war"](xml/oclc_4770057679-i_91.TEIP5.xml#div_26.d1e3075), which would mean that it was not published before November 1915 (Muḥarram 1334 aH) and most likely in 1916. Issue 12 of the same volume even recorded a [notebook for the year 1917](xml/oclc_4770057679-i_94.TEIP5.xml#p_384.d1e4223) in the section on new books and publications, which also listed further books published in 1334 aH. The following issue continues this trend by publishing an [obituary for Shaykh ʿAbd al-Razzāq al-Bayṭār](xml/oclc_4770057679-i_95.TEIP5.xml#div_16.d1e2869), who died in Damascus on 10 Rab 1335 [4 January 1917].
