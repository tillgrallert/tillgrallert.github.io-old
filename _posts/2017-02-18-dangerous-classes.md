On 26 January this year I had a chance to present a paper on food riots titled "Women in the streets! Urban food riots in late Ottoman *Bilād al-Shām*" at the conference ["The 'Dangerous Classes' in the Middle East and North Africa"](https://www.sant.ox.ac.uk/events/conference-%E2%80%9Cdangerous-classes%E2%80%9D-middle-east-and-north-africa) organised by Stephanie Cronin at St. Antony's college, University of Oxford.

As always, I have made the slides available on [GitHub](https://tillgrallert.github.io/Slides/2017-Oxford).
