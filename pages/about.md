For the time being, a short introduction to both the name of the page and the person(s) behind shall suffice. 

**Sitzextase** is a German neologism translating into the ecstasy of sitting. Some years ago we sat around the kitchen table with some drinks (and in one case without) and had a splendid discussion on a topic long since forgotten. Suddenly we felt the urge to label our evening endeavours appropriately. And there we go. "Sitzextase" was a term too good to vanish with the evening and the pertinent illustration for the historian’s work and thus a domain was ever since duely paid for. Recently, the site was converted to a static page with the help [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and moved to [GitHub pages](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/). 

<!-- So, who sat around the kitchen table then?

The hat tip for coining the term goes to Christoph.  The historian who ever since rescued "Sitzextase" from "the enormous condescension of posterity" – a quote too tempting not to apply in this context despite its sorrowful fate of being cherry-picked from E.P. Thompson’s otherwise rather unread work and being cited by almost every work remotely concerned with "social history" (A fate that it shares with some of Marx’ stances on men making their own history or, even worse, the issue of history repeating itself) – is me, named for some rather obscure reasons after a mediaeval jester, clown, and avenger of the poor and disenfranchised, Till Eulenspiegel. Apparently, social conventions had to be followed and I inherited my father’s family name and thus the Eulenspiegel was dropped for a not less uncommon Grallert. Till Grallert then it is and I shall stick to the name for now. -->

**Till Grallert** is a social historian and a research associate at the [Orient-Institut Beirut](http://www.orient-institut.org) of the [Max Weber Foundation](http://www.maxweberstiftung.de/). He completed his Ph.D. with a thesis titled "To Whom Belong the Streets? Property, Propriety, and Appropriation: The Production of Public Space in Late Ottoman Damascus, 1875-1914." in 2014 at the [Berlin Graduate School Muslim Cultures and Societies](http://www.bgsmcs.fu-berlin.de/). His current research project <!-- under the working title "women in the street" --> aims at establishing a genealogy of urban food riots in the Eastern Mediterranean between the eighteenth and the twentieth centuries. In addition to the social and spatial history of late Ottoman cities, he developed a strong interest in digital humanities and the socio-linguistics of early Arabic newspapers.  He is a co-organiser of the "Digital Humanities Institute - Beirut" (since 2015), the lead developer for and a contributor to the online chronology of nineteenth century Arabic periodicals ([Project Jarāʾid](http://www.zmo.de/jaraid)), and a contributor to the recent collection of essays titled "Digital Humanities and Islamic & Middle East Studies" (ed. Elias Muhanna, 2016). He works on open, collaborative and scholarly digital editions of early Arabic periodicals such as [Muḥammad Kurd ʿAlī's journal *al-Muqtabas*](https://github.com/tillgrallert/digital-muqtabas/) and [ʿAbd al-Qādir Iskandarānī's *al-Ḥaqāʾiq*](https://github.com/OpenArabicPE/digital-haqaiq) in the framework of his research project "Open Arabic Periodical Editions" ([OpenArabicPE](https://github.com/OpenArabicPE/)).
