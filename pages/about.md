For he time being, a short introduction to both the name of the page and the person(s) behind shall suffice. "Sitzextase" is a German neologism translating into the ecstasy of sitting. Some years ago we sat around the kitchen table with some drinks (and in one case without) and had a splendid discussion on a topic long since forgotten. Suddenly we felt the urge to label our evening endeavours appropriately. And there we go. "Sitzextase" was a term too good to vanish with the evening and the pertinent illustration for the historian’s work and thus a domain was ever since duely paid for. Recently, the site was converted to a static page with the help [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and moved to [GitHub pages](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/). 

<!-- So, who sat around the kitchen table then?

The hat tip for coining the term goes to Christoph.  The historian who ever since rescued "Sitzextase" from "the enormous condescension of posterity" – a quote too tempting not to apply in this context despite its sorrowful fate of being cherry-picked from E.P. Thompson’s otherwise rather unread work and being cited by almost every work remotely concerned with "social history" (A fate that it shares with some of Marx’ stances on men making their own history or, even worse, the issue of history repeating itself) – is me, named for some rather obscure reasons after a mediaeval jester, clown, and avenger of the poor and disenfranchised, Till Eulenspiegel. Apparently, social conventions had to be followed and I inherited my father’s family name and thus the Eulenspiegel was dropped for a not less uncommon Grallert. Till Grallert then it is and I shall stick to the name for now. -->
