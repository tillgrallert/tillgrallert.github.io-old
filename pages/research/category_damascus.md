Between 2009 and 2014 I worked on a doctoral thesis titled "To whom belong the streets? Property, propriety, and appropriation: The production of public space in late Ottoman Damascus, 1875--1914" at the [Berlin Graduate School Muslim Cultures and Societies](https://www.bgsmcs.fu-berlin.de/), [Freie Universit√§t Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/), and I currently work on transforming the thesis into a book. 

This site is dedicated to this research project.
