# Text Encoding Fundamentals and their Application, [DHSI](https://www.dhsi.org) 2015, 1-5 June 2015, UVic

Slides for all sessions are available [here]({{site.baseurl}}/TeachingTei/slides/slidesDHSI2015/index.html)

This five-day course will provide a hands-on introduction to digital editing practices and tools employing a set of XML-based technologies: The Extensible Markup Language (XML) istself ([specifications]( http://www.w3.org/TR/xml11), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML).), the XPath data model ([specifications](http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-datamodel/.), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath).), the declarative language to transform XML (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations, XSLT)([specifications](http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT)), and finally a specific "dialect" of XML, the [Text Encoding Initiative's TEI P5](http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml "the TEI Consortium's Website"). The course will cover the process from the original creation of digital files using TEI XML to retrieval of data and publication to the web using XSLT. 

We will do so on the basis of late nineteenth-century manuscripts of British diplomatic correspondence from Damascus and the first bi-lingual, English and Arabic, weekly newspaper published in the USA, *Kawkab America*. Digital images, as well as sample encodings will be provided. 

Finally, we will problematise the applicability of the TEI to non-European languages written in non-Latin scripts, particularly Arabic and Ottoman.

No previous programming skills or knowledge of mark-up languages is required, even though previous experiences are an advantage. The course will be adapted to the needs of registered participants.

# From analogue documents to electronic texts: Introduction to TEI XML editing in multilingual environments, [DHI Beirut](https://dhibeirut.wordpress.com) 2015, 2-6 March 2015

The course will cover the process from the original creation of digital files using TEI XML to the publication of XML files using XSLT. To do so in a meaningful way, each participant will encode a single issue of one of Beirut's many newspapers covering the restoration of the Ottoman constitution in summer 1908.Finally, we will problematise the applicability of the TEI to non-European languages written in non-Latin scripts, particularly Arabic and Ottoman.

No previous programming skills or knowledge of mark-up languages is required, even though previous experiences are an advantage. The course will be adapted to the needs of registered participants.


# The Shitting Duck: Mechanisierung, Magie und Sozio-technische Systeme

Ever since the beginnings of the Enlightenment, the importance of automatons, mechanization, and algorithmic methods has steadily increased. While the first automatons were built with the intention to imitate life in one way or another, it was the second generation that played a major part in the industrial revolution: Instead of imitating life, they begin to replace it by taking over tasks which were previously carried out by human workers. With the second industrial revolution, mechanization becomes technology and previously unconnected individual machines become integrated in a larger socio-technical context consisting of a net of interwoven actions by humans and machines. 

At the same time, this development convoys a sacred promise of salvation: Technology promises everlasting and rapid progress and through it the end of all mundane torments such as manual labor, illnesses, natural disasters, hunger, and so on. Magical rituals of complexity and rationality beyond the comprehension of the individual inaugurate engineers as our new priests. They are supposedly leading the way to prevent the foreseeable end of our physical world - all this in the face of our past experience that taught us the power of technology to destroy. 

On the basis of these developments, this seminar examines the history and future of the term technology. We will attempt to understand technology as ideology, that is the ways in which technology reverses the relationship of high and applied arts, of physical and mental processes, of objects and ideas, and of enslaved and free man. In this process, technology is rendered as an object. It influences our life world while it remains at the same time magically shielded from our grasp. Is it possible to unriddle this reification, even to reverse it? First signs of yet another ideological shift appear on the horizon with the Web 2.0 and 3.0, which we are going to explore in the last part of the seminar. 

The syllabus for this English-speaking post-graduate seminar, which I taught together with [Martin Dege](http://www.technopolis.nu) at Universität Konstanz during the summer semester 2014, can be found [here](https://ilias.uni-konstanz.de/ilias/data/ilias_uni/lm_data/lm_374778/syllabus.html).

# Praxisbezug der Islamwissenschaft

My German-speaking blog for the mandatory under-graduate course "Praxisbezug der Islamwissenschaft", titled "Recherchieren, lesen, diskutieren, schreiben: Eine Einführung in die Geisteswissenschaften entlang Edward Saids ‘Orientalism’," which I taught during the winter term 2011/12 at Freie Universität Berlin, is hosted by the [university](http://blogs.fu-berlin.de/praxisbezug-islamwissenschaft/kursbeschreibung/).
